<li>SF#38762 – Corrects a lost shading problem by changing the default color conversion strategy to sRGB.</li>
<li>SF#38766 – Corrects a problem with doubled up horizontal lines in PDF output by increasing the precision in the Normalizer page content optimizing algorithm.</li>
<li>SF#38837 – Corrects a problem where Normalizer saw Cambria and Cambria Math as the same font and failed to include Cambria Math in the output PDF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Normalizer v 10.0PlusP2e</strong> (December 17, 2015)</p>
<p>Problem Corrections</p>
<ul>
<li>SF#37964 – Corrects a limitation of the Normalizer demonorm interface "--disableautot1embed=on" switch implementation that just provided a mechanism for users to disable embedding type 1 fonts that exceed 229 characters.</li>
<li>SF#38134 – Corrects a problem with logo shading loss when Normalizer demonorm was used without a joboptions file to convert an EPS file to a PDF file. Normalizer’s default “ColorConversionStrategy” was changed from “LeaveColorUnchanged” to “sRGB”. This can correct shading problems, but does potentially switch the PS color space to “sRGB” on conversion to PDF. If it is desired to leave the PS color space unchanged, then the use of a joboptions file specifying “ColorConversionStrategy” is recommended.</li>
