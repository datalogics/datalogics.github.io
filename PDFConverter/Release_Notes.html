<p>Problem Corrections</p>
<ul>
<li>SF#37964 – Corrects a limitation of the Normalizer demonorm interface "--disableautot1embed=on" switch implementation that just provided a mechanism for users to disable embedding type 1 fonts that exceed 229 characters.</li>
<li>SF#38134 – Corrects a problem with logo shading loss when Normalizer demonorm was used without a joboptions file to convert an EPS file to a PDF file. Normalizer’s default “ColorConversionStrategy” was changed from “LeaveColorUnchanged” to “sRGB”. This can correct shading problems, but does potentially switch the PS color space to “sRGB” on conversion to PDF. If it is desired to leave the PS color space unchanged, then the use of a joboptions file specifying “ColorConversionStrategy” is recommended.</li>
</ul>

Updating the product version will now be part of the release procedure to make distinguishing between Normalizer releases easier.</li>
