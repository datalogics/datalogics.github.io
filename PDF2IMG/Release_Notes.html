<p><strong>Version 4.0.2</strong> (May 22, 2020)<br />
Enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds new PDF output options for rasterizing each PDF page and saving as separate PDF files or one combined PDF file.</li>
<li>Preserves previous feature to split PDF input to one PDF output per page without rasterizing, but this now requires a new option to be selected.</li>

<li>SF#39462 – Corrects an issue that caused a crash when converting to TIFF.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Version 3.3.0</strong> (May 30, 2019)<br />
Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolves an issue where a single page in a PDF document was taking 15 to 20 minutes to render because of vector images. Changes the setting for the kPDPageThreadIPParse flag in drawParam to default to multi-threaded processing, rather than the original single threaded processing. PNG, TIF and JPG images covered.</li>
<li>Corrects a problem where PDF2IMG was failing to complete processing for a PDF document where a customer had set the Names parameter to “All” for the DeviceN color space. This violates a rule in the ISO 32000 standard, followed by PDF2IMG, that reserves DeviceN to Separation only.  Set the relaxation flag (PDPrefSetAllowRelexedSyntax) to true to ignore this specification. Relaxing this parsing restriction allows PDF2IMG to continue to draw the pages to TIF images. The user needs to add the "-relaxParseSyntax" option to the command line syntax.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Version 3.2.0</strong> (April 28, 2019)<br />
Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrects a situation where outdated binary files were sometimes applied to the product after an upgrade or after the software was re-installed.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where license extensions could fail without administrator access to the installation directory.</li>
<li>Removes underscore characters from the product name in the installer and in the Windows uninstall menu. Product is consistently displayed as "PDF2IMG Standard," "PDF2IMG Pro," and "PDF2IMG Premium."</li>
<li>Changes name of installer files to conform to standard naming conventions for command line applications.</li>
<li>Adds compatibility for self-hosted license server.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 3.0.0</strong> (November 8, 2018)</p>
<p>Enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separates PDF2IMG into three product offerings, PDF2IMG Standard, Pro, and Premium.</li>
<li>Updates the license-managed platform to support automatic evaluations and subscription services, offered online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product installation now places the required Adobe PDF Library components for PDF2IMG in a location that is less likely to interfere with other systems that also use the Adobe PDF Library.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.5P1e</strong> (April 25, 2018)</p>
<p>Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removes .NET framework requirement from the Windows installer to correct a problem with installing on Windows 10 platforms.</li>
<li>Updates open source graphics libraries (libjpeg, libtiff, PNGLib, ZLib) to latest versions in to address security concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Version 2.5P1d</strong> (February 5, 2018)</p>
<p>Enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds new directory, "Resources," to provide support files with the distribution.</li>
<li>Adds ICC profiles to the distribution.</li>
<li>Adds new .NET interface to the Windows 32-bit distribution.</li>
<li>Adds new command line option (-removewhitespace), and new API to the .NET interface (GetPageBoxWithWhiteSpaceRemoved) that remove white space margins from around the page.</li>
<li>Adds two APIs to the C++ interface (pdf2img_get_page_width, pdf2img_get_page_height) and the .NET interface (GetPageWidth, GetPageHeight) that return the page width and height of a document from an initialized ImageConversion object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevents a rasterization error that could occur for very large image sizes by improving a previous limitation of the resampler.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Version 2.5P1b</strong> (November 8, 2017)</p>
<p>Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Version 2.5P1a</strong> (September 18, 2017)</p>
<p>Enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates to PDF2IMG to use Adobe PDF Library version 15.0.4.</li>
<li>Adds a feature to the pdfregion command line argument that allows a user to define a custom region by using a set of four coordinates. The coordinates define the position and size of a bounding area on a page.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixes gray color model crash</li>
