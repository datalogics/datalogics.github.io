        <h1>Release Notes, Datalogics PDF Optimizer</h1>
  
	<div class="entry-content">
<p><strong>Version 3.2</strong> (May 17, 2023)<br/>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The json category <b>pdfx-conversion</b> supports <b>type</b> values of <b>3</b> and <b>1a</b> now for PDF/X-3 and PDF/X-1a support respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 3.1.1</strong> (Feb 23, 2023)<br/>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF/X conversion is now supported via a new json category "pdfx-conversion" with keys of: "enabled" with allowed values of "on" or "off" and "type" with an allowed value of "4".  A new PDFX-4.json profile is distributed as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A new option <b>consolidate-duplicate-objects</b> has been added which replaces the older option <b>consolidate-duplicate-images-and-forms</b>, the newer option can lead to better results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDFOPT-228 – This corrects an intermittent crash that could occur when running the program.</li>
<li>PDFOPT-224 – Color conversion performance has been improved for large documents.</li>
<li>PDFOPT-223 – Behavior has been changed to support optimizing Signed documents, the result will no longer be signed.</li>
<li>PDFOPT-221 – This improves the result when Color Conversion is enabled.</li>
<li>PDFOPT-220 – This corrects a problem with Color Conversion for some documents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 3.0</strong> (March 8, 2022)<br/>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves PDF file compression when using PDFOptimizer.
<ul>
<li>Includes new compressionLow.json, compressionMedium.json, and compressionHigh.json profiles with the product.
<ul>
<li>These are finely tuned compression-driven profiles to produce smaller output PDF documents. These profiles offer different balances of the reduction in the file size and preservation of the data.</li>
<li>Note: If you are not sure what level of compression you need, it is recommended to use the compressionMedium profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The lossless, maximum, mobile, and standard profiles have been removed from the package. The profiles will continue to work if these profiles are being used currently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SF#43117 – Improves the handling of an image that contains more data than expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>SF#43685 – Corrects an issue in which a confusing error message could be displayed when the output file was larger than the input file.</li>
<li>SF#44128 – Corrects an issue in font optimization that could create an incorrect output.</li>
<li>SF#44166 – Corrects an issue in which PDFOptimizer could exit silently due to a syntax error in a JSON profile.</li>
<li>SF#44274 – Adds a new condition to the PDPrefSetRelaxedSyntax logic to complete the processing of a defective pdf.</li>
<li>Corrects an issue in which an internal error could occur when trying to flatten transparencies</li>
<li class="gmail_default">Corrects an issue in which a generic error could be reported after an unsuccessful PDF/A conversion.</li>
<li class="gmail_default">Corrects an issue in which discarding Unused Forms would not work as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.1</strong> (May 13, 2021)<br />
New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds support for PDF/A variant-specific compliant profiles. Previously, users could choose the "archival" profile (which was not the default profile for PDF Optimizer, but it was available) to optimize their input files to meet PDFA-3b compliance standards.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;">The previous "archival" profile COULD support additional PDF/A compliance variants; however, users were required to make that specification manually when using the "archival" profile.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;">Now, we removed the "archival" profile (whose default was one variant) that required manual interaction to utilize multiple PDF/A variants, and we include 5 distinct PDF/A variant profiles so users can simply choose the compliance/archival/standard variant at the profile level without needing to tweak the profile itself.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;">New profile identifiers are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>PDFA-1b.json</li>
<li>PDFA-2b.json</li>
<li>PDFA-2u.json</li>
<li>PDFA-3b.json</li>
<li>PDFA-3u.json</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adds support for Digimaster-specific print profile.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;">Previously, no Digimaster profile existed leaving Digimaster printer users to "fend for themselves" as it relates to configuration for their printing needs. Now, Digimaster printer users have a baseline profile that is specific to the Digimaster print experience which downsamples images to 600dpi (when applicable), and converts all images to black and white by default to align with the standard optimization experience our Digimaster customers who optimize for print expect.</p>

<li>PDF Optimizer Includes latest version of the PDF Checker tool.</li>
<li>For Windows, the PDF Optimizer installer includes an option to subsequently run the PDF Checker installer.</li>
<li>For Linux, the distribution includes a PDF Checker self extracting installation file, which prompts the user to accept a license agreement. Then, the process allows for the installation of PDF Checker in a default directory under the current or designated directory.</li>
<li>Adds support of a new JSON Color Conversion category. User may select a color profile to apply, define a conversion intent, and replace existing calibrated profiles in the PDF document with a different profile.</li>
