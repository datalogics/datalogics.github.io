<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves PDF file compression when using PDFOptimizer.
<ul>
<li>Includes new compressionLow.json, compressionMedium.json, and compressionHigh.json profiles with the product.
<ul>
<li>These are finely tuned compression-driven profiles to produce smaller output PDF documents. These profiles offer different balances of the reduction in the file size and preservation of the data.</li>
<li>Note: If you are not sure what level of compression you need, it is recommended to use the compressionMedium profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The lossless, maximum, mobile, and standard profiles have been removed from the package. The profiles will continue to work if these profiles are being used currently.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Version 2.1</strong> (May 13, 2021)<br />
New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds support for PDF/A variant-specific compliant profiles. Previously, users could choose the "archival" profile (which was not the default profile for PDF Optimizer, but it was available) to optimize their input files to meet PDFA-3b compliance standards.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;">The previous "archival" profile COULD support additional PDF/A compliance variants; however, users were required to make that specification manually when using the "archival" profile.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;">Now, we removed the "archival" profile (whose default was one variant) that required manual interaction to utilize multiple PDF/A variants, and we include 5 distinct PDF/A variant profiles so users can simply choose the compliance/archival/standard variant at the profile level without needing to tweak the profile itself.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;">New profile identifiers are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>PDFA-1b.json</li>
<li>PDFA-2b.json</li>
<li>PDFA-2u.json</li>
<li>PDFA-3b.json</li>
<li>PDFA-3u.json</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adds support for Digimaster-specific print profile.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 24px;">Previously, no Digimaster profile existed leaving Digimaster printer users to "fend for themselves" as it relates to configuration for their printing needs. Now, Digimaster printer users have a baseline profile that is specific to the Digimaster print experience which downsamples images to 600dpi (when applicable), and converts all images to black and white by default to align with the standard optimization experience our Digimaster customers who optimize for print expect.</p>

<ul>
<li>PDF Optimizer Includes latest version of the PDF Checker tool.</li>
<li>For Windows, the PDF Optimizer installer includes an option to subsequently run the PDF Checker installer.</li>
<li>For Linux, the distribution includes a PDF Checker self extracting installation file, which prompts the user to accept a license agreement. Then, the process allows for the installation of PDF Checker in a default directory under the current or designated directory.</li>
<li>Adds support of a new JSON Color Conversion category. User may select a color profile to apply, define a conversion intent, and replace existing calibrated profiles in the PDF document with a different profile.</li>

<li>Adds optimization for 16-bit per channel (bpc) J2K images (a compression format for JPEG image files) and applies subsampling to JPEG compression.</li>
<li>Adds new option "write-output-even-if-increase-in-size" that can be used to decide whether to keep outputs when they cannot be reduced in size.</li>
<li>Renames the option "optimize-only-if-reduction-in-size" to "optimize-images-only-if-reduction-in-size" for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem Corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrects an issue when flattening is enabled with certain documents that specified a Page Blending Color Space.</li>
<li>Corrects Details information shown under Windows pdfoptimizer.exe file.  File description shows "Datalogics PDF Optimizer" while the original filename shows "pdfoptimizer.exe".</li>
<li>Corrects Linux issue where multiple copies of the Adobe PDF Library were included in the installation package.</li>
<li>Removes a potential problem starting up the program on certain Windows machines in which "api-ms-win-core-libraryloader-l1-1-1.dll" is reported as missing.</li>
