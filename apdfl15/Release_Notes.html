</ul>
<strong>APDFL v15.0.4PlusP4a </strong>(8/20/2018)
Enhancements:
<ul>
 	<li>Adds new property DisableAlphaChannelGeneration to the ImageSaveParams class, defaulting to false. When set to false, RGB images with a mask present are combined to create a 32-bit RGBA output (only relevant for PNG and TIFF). When set to true, the output does not include the mask.</li>
 	<li>Changes the set of released profiles to exclude profiles of version 3, which APDFL is not able to use. The set now consists of 33 profiles, which are all either freely redistributable from Adobe or are reflections of the internally defined profiles.</li>
 	<li>Adds new entry outputIntentName to the PDF/x and PDF/a control structures as an ASText object. When left NULL, conversion continues to use sRGB as profile for RGB documents, and SWOP for CMYK documents. When set to a valid description for a profile findable via resources that is of the proper color model for the type of conversion, this profile is used as the output intent profile for the converted document.  Also adds new Java/C# interface attribute ProfileDesc, to both the PDFAConvertParams and the PDFXConvertParams objects. When this attribute is set, and the profile describes a valid profile, findable in resources, of a color model that matches the conversion requirements, the profile is used as the output intent profile for the converted document.</li>
 	<li>Improves rendering performance of a PDF page with thousands of invalid Form XObject streams.</li>
 	<li>Adds new flag PDInsertDoNotResolveInvalidStructureParentReferences to be used with PDDocInsertPages() to improve performance.</li>
 	<li>Adds new option PDFOptimizerDiscardUnusedImages to PDFOptimizer, defaulting to true, which removes images in the document's resources that aren't used in the document's content.</li>
</ul>
Problem Corrections:
<ul>
 	<li>Adds AIX-compatibility for previous resolution to correct an issue with the encoding of the Title field when printing a PDF to PostScript.</li>
 	<li>Corrects a crash that could occur flattening a document with an invalid AcroForms Calculation Order entry.</li>
 	<li>Corrects an issue in subsetting previously embedded TrueType fonts in which the CIDToGIDMap entry, when present in the font, was not used in setting the glyphs to be used in the subset.</li>
 	<li>Corrects an issue in vertical placement logic that added a large pad above the first line.</li>
 	<li>Corrects a small memory leak that occurred when optimizing images.</li>
 	<li>Corrects an error that could occur retrieving a document's attachments.</li>

Enhancements:
<ul>
 	<li>Adds a new .NET/Java interface property PDFDict to the Container class.</li>
 	<li>Adds a new attribute PDFOptimizerResubsetSubsetFonts to the list of Optimizer attributes. Turned off by default. When true, this attempts to re-subset fonts which are already subset and embedded, which may be used to remove glyphs from a subset font when the document has been edited.</li>

 	<li>ConvertPDFtoPostScript – Convert the contents of the input PDF file into a newPostScript file.</li>
 	<li>ConvertPDFtoEPS – Convert the contents of each page of the input PDF file into a separate Encapsulated PostScript file.</li>
 	<li>PDFPrintGUI – Print a PDF file to a printer using the platform’s Print Interface GUI (Windows only for this release).</li>
</ul>
New APIs

Two new APIs have been introduced in this release to control black point compensation for AC*() calls ─ ACGetBlackPointCompensation() and ACSetBlackPointCompensation(). Black point compensation maps the darkest point of one profile to the darkest point of another profile during color conversion. Previously, while converting one ICC based profile to another, the lightest points of these profiles were mapped; now you can choose whether to add darkest point mapping or not. By default, only the lightest point mapping is used.

Enhancements:
<ul>
 	<li>This release now supports conversion of spots to its alternate color space using the tint transformation. Previous releases supported conversion of spots to process colors only.</li>
 	<li>Option to set default Transparency Blending Color Space has been added in this release. If no value is specified for this option, the default value ‘Working CMYK’ is used. Previously, there was no option to set default Transparency Blending Color Space other than the default value ‘Working CMYK’.</li>
 	<li>This release now supports creation of 16-bit DeviceN images with n number of colorants. Previously, creation of 16-bit DeviceN images was supported only with 1, 3, and 4 number of colorants.</li>
</ul>
Problem Corrections:
<ul>
 	<li>Corrects a segmentation fault termination of applications that attempt to use one of the plug-ins (such as the PDFlattener) on a Sparc32 Solaris11 machine.</li>
 	<li>Corrects a problem where a page fails to render, silently, when it contains a corrupted image. Added a mechanism allowing the customer to direct APDFL to throw an exception instead.</li>
 	<li>Corrects handling of widths in PDEElementGetWIdth() when the element is a PDEText element.</li>
 	<li>Corrects a problem that prevented embedding, without subsetting, type 0 fonts.</li>
 	<li>Modifies APDFL handling of a badly formed font to tolerate and skip a truncated glyph outline description, rather than repeatedly re-parse the font. In most scenarios, all characters are correctly processed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>APDFL v15.0.0PlusP1b</strong> (5/27/2016)

Problem Corrections:
<ul>
 	<li>Fixes problems for DLE applications failing to find system fonts.</li>
</ul>
<strong>APDFL v15.0.0PlusP1a</strong> (5/18/2016)

<b>Revamped Existing Samples.</b> This has been a feature requested by our customers. As a result of this request, we have revamped and expanded the samples in our new 15.0 distribution. Some regrouping has been done under the APDFL samples path, where you will now find two subfolder. The Samples_Adobe folder holds the original sample applications distributed with the Adobe build of the Library, and Samples contains the newer applications created by Datalogics. We also renamed the drawtomemory sample “Renderpage,” and moved it to the Samples folder.

<b>PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3 Conversion</b>. PDF/X is the standard in the graphics arts and press fields for conveying accurate, complete PDF proofs and documents for printing. This new functionality can be seen in the PDFProcessor sample (in the C++ applications) or PDFXConverter samples (in C# and Java applications).

<b>Black Point Compensation</b>. Black Point Compensation can now be enabled or disabled when using the Adobe Color Engine color transformation API in the Adobe PDF Library. Two new APIs have been added to support this functionality: ACGetBlackPointCompensation() and ACSetBlackPointCompensation().

Black point compensation maps the darkest point of one profile to the darkest point of another profile during color conversion. Previously, while converting one ICC-based profile to another, the lightest points of these profiles were mapped; now you can choose whether to add darkest point mapping. By default, only the lightest point mapping is used.

<b>Transparency Blending Color Space</b>. Users can now set the transparency blending color space used for rendering, printing and flattening PDF documents. If no value is specified for this option, the default value "Working CMYK" is used. Previously, there was no option to set default Transparency Blending Color Space other than the default.

<b>Performance Improvements in Importing and Merging</b>. Users should see performance improvements when importing pages and merging documents when working with large PDF files. The exact degree of improvement depends in part on the complexity and quantity of the documents involved, but some better performance should be seen as compared with previous release series.
