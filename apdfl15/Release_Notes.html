<h2>End of Support for APDFL v15.0.4</h2>

<p>On February 01, 2025, Datalogics will end support for APDFL v15.0.4. This affects both the APDFL and/or Forms Extension release that is using version 15.0.4 libraries.</p> 

<p>Customers can continue to use said products but there will no longer be any bug fixes, enhancements or updates, based off version 15.0.4 libraries after the deadline.</p> 

<p>To avoid any disruption in operations, we strongly recommend that users upgrade to the latest release, which is using version 18.0.5 libraries, before February 2025. The latest release is available for download through our FTP /Products/apdfl/... area.</p>

<strong>APDFL v15.0.4PlusP4c </strong>(9/17/2018)
Enhancements:
<ul>
 	<li>A new sample program, TextSelectEnum, was added to demonstrate the use of PDDocCreateTextSelect and PDTextSelectEnumUCS.</li>
</ul>
Problem Corrections:
<ul>
 	<li>Corrects an issue rendering content by ignoring invalidly formed Halftone entries in an extended GState when relaxed syntax is permitted.</li>
 	<li>Corrects an internal limitation of decoding a JPEG2000 image during rasterization in 64-bit.</li>
 	<li>Corrects an issue with flattening. An image would be lost during composition when resampling when applying an increase in resolution by 1.25 to 10 times, and using an image with a separation color that was also a process color name. Also corrects an issue in which the profile passed into the ProfileDesc in the Flatten Parameters could sometimes be ignored as the blending space for the flattening process.</li>
 	<li>Corrects a problem where a JPG image on the page of a PDF document would fail to render because of an empty DHT marker.</li>

<strong>APDFL v15.0.4PlusP4a </strong>(8/20/2018)
Enhancements:
<ul>
 	<li>Adds new property DisableAlphaChannelGeneration to the ImageSaveParams class, defaulting to false. When set to false, RGB images with a mask present are combined to create a 32-bit RGBA output (only relevant for PNG and TIFF). When set to true, the output does not include the mask.</li>
 	<li>Changes the set of released profiles to exclude profiles of version 3, which APDFL is not able to use. The set now consists of 33 profiles, which are all either freely redistributable from Adobe or are reflections of the internally defined profiles.</li>
 	<li>Adds new entry outputIntentName to the PDF/x and PDF/a control structures as an ASText object. When left NULL, conversion continues to use sRGB as profile for RGB documents, and SWOP for CMYK documents. When set to a valid description for a profile findable via resources that is of the proper color model for the type of conversion, this profile is used as the output intent profile for the converted document.  Also adds new Java/C# interface attribute ProfileDesc, to both the PDFAConvertParams and the PDFXConvertParams objects. When this attribute is set, and the profile describes a valid profile, findable in resources, of a color model that matches the conversion requirements, the profile is used as the output intent profile for the converted document.</li>
 	<li>Improves rendering performance of a PDF page with thousands of invalid Form XObject streams.</li>
 	<li>Adds new flag PDInsertDoNotResolveInvalidStructureParentReferences to be used with PDDocInsertPages() to improve performance.</li>

 	<li>PDFPrintGUI – Print a PDF file to a printer using the platform’s Print Interface GUI (Windows only for this release).</li>
</ul>
New APIs

Two new APIs have been introduced in this release to control black point compensation for AC*() calls ─ ACGetBlackPointCompensation() and ACSetBlackPointCompensation(). Black point compensation maps the darkest point of one profile to the darkest point of another profile during color conversion. Previously, while converting one ICC based profile to another, the lightest points of these profiles were mapped; now you can choose whether to add darkest point mapping or not. By default, only the lightest point mapping is used.

Enhancements:
<ul>
 	<li>This release now supports conversion of spots to its alternate color space using the tint transformation. Previous releases supported conversion of spots to process colors only.</li>
 	<li>Option to set default Transparency Blending Color Space has been added in this release. If no value is specified for this option, the default value ‘Working CMYK’ is used. Previously, there was no option to set default Transparency Blending Color Space other than the default value ‘Working CMYK’.</li>
 	<li>This release now supports creation of 16-bit DeviceN images with n number of colorants. Previously, creation of 16-bit DeviceN images was supported only with 1, 3, and 4 number of colorants.</li>
</ul>
Problem Corrections:
<ul>
 	<li>Corrects a segmentation fault termination of applications that attempt to use one of the plug-ins (such as the PDFlattener) on a Sparc32 Solaris11 machine.</li>
 	<li>Corrects a problem where a page fails to render, silently, when it contains a corrupted image. Added a mechanism allowing the customer to direct APDFL to throw an exception instead.</li>
 	<li>Corrects handling of widths in PDEElementGetWIdth() when the element is a PDEText element.</li>
 	<li>Corrects a problem that prevented embedding, without subsetting, type 0 fonts.</li>
 	<li>Modifies APDFL handling of a badly formed font to tolerate and skip a truncated glyph outline description, rather than repeatedly re-parse the font. In most scenarios, all characters are correctly processed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>APDFL v15.0.0PlusP1b</strong> (5/27/2016)

Problem Corrections:
<ul>
 	<li>Fixes problems for DLE applications failing to find system fonts.</li>
</ul>
<strong>APDFL v15.0.0PlusP1a</strong> (5/18/2016)

<b>Revamped Existing Samples.</b> This has been a feature requested by our customers. As a result of this request, we have revamped and expanded the samples in our new 15.0 distribution. Some regrouping has been done under the APDFL samples path, where you will now find two subfolder. The Samples_Adobe folder holds the original sample applications distributed with the Adobe build of the Library, and Samples contains the newer applications created by Datalogics. We also renamed the drawtomemory sample “Renderpage,” and moved it to the Samples folder.

<b>PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3 Conversion</b>. PDF/X is the standard in the graphics arts and press fields for conveying accurate, complete PDF proofs and documents for printing. This new functionality can be seen in the PDFProcessor sample (in the C++ applications) or PDFXConverter samples (in C# and Java applications).

<b>Black Point Compensation</b>. Black Point Compensation can now be enabled or disabled when using the Adobe Color Engine color transformation API in the Adobe PDF Library. Two new APIs have been added to support this functionality: ACGetBlackPointCompensation() and ACSetBlackPointCompensation().

Black point compensation maps the darkest point of one profile to the darkest point of another profile during color conversion. Previously, while converting one ICC-based profile to another, the lightest points of these profiles were mapped; now you can choose whether to add darkest point mapping. By default, only the lightest point mapping is used.

<b>Transparency Blending Color Space</b>. Users can now set the transparency blending color space used for rendering, printing and flattening PDF documents. If no value is specified for this option, the default value "Working CMYK" is used. Previously, there was no option to set default Transparency Blending Color Space other than the default.

<b>Performance Improvements in Importing and Merging</b>. Users should see performance improvements when importing pages and merging documents when working with large PDF files. The exact degree of improvement depends in part on the complexity and quantity of the documents involved, but some better performance should be seen as compared with previous release series.
